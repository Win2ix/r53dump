r53dump will connect to AWS Route53 service and dump all zones in Bind format for the specified account.
Logging is done to syslog (check /var/log/syslog). Multiple accounts, multilpe zones are supported. "cli53" is
used for all connectivity with AWS systems. Dumped zones can optionally be sent to s3 automatically.

Usage/Setup:

1) Install cli53 https://github.com/barnybug/cli53.git

2) Install s3cmd (available via apt-get)

3) Create /etc/r53dump.conf and add this (or copy a working one):

# Path to cli53 binary
cli53=/usr/local/bin/cli53
s3cmd=s3cmd
s3bucket="s3://your-bucket"


4) Set your AWS access keys in one file per account (like win2ix.auth). You can have more than one.
The format is like this:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAJGNWBPJJKSWCHEMZ
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='2ma263OF+16cLlWWl0eS2MdLZa/SdhSTXHGgBAt9'


4) Start r53dump

./r53dump authConfigFile saveDirectory

authConfigFile = the file created in step 4
saveDirectory = a directory to store downloaded zone files
