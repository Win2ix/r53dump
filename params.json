Multiple accounts, multilpe zones are supported. \"cli53\" is\r\nused for all connectivity with AWS systems. Dumped zones can optionally be sent to s3 automatically.\r\n\r\nUsage/Setup:\r\n\r\n1) Install cli53 https://github.com/barnybug/cli53.git\r\n\r\n2) Install s3cmd (available via apt-get)\r\n\r\n3) Create /etc/r53dump.conf and add this (or copy a working one):\r\n\r\ncli53=/usr/local/bin/cli53\r\ns3cmd=s3cmd\r\ns3bucket=\"s3://your-bucket\"\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Set your AWS access keys in one file per account (like win2ix.auth). You can have more than one.\r\nThe format is like this:\r\n\r\nexport AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAJGNWBPJJKSWCHEMZ\r\nexport AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='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'\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Start r53dump\r\n\r\n./r53dump authConfigFile saveDirectory\r\n\r\nauthConfigFile = the file created in step 4\r\nsaveDirectory = a directory to store downloaded zone files\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
